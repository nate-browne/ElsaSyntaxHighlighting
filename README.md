### Introduction

Vim doesn't know about Elsa files, so this repository provides files to use so
that vim can do syntax highlighting for elsa files (`.lc` files). More
information about Elsa can be found [here](https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/elsa)

### Setup

1. If you don't already have one, create a directory in your home directory
called `.vim`.

2. Move both of the provided directories into your `.vim` directory.

3. That's it!
